## Getting Started

To start using **DjangoPlus**, clone the repository and follow the setup steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Theetawee/DJANGO-PLUS.git
cd djangoplus-boilerplate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

For fixed versions:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the latest versions of dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

### 3. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**:  
   Configure a `.env` file for sensitive settings such as database credentials, secret keys, etc. Make sure the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to avoid exposing sensitive information.

2. **Admin Access**:  
   Enable Djangoâ€™s admin panel by setting `ADMIN_ENABLED=True` in your environment variables and customize the admin URL via `ADMIN_URL` for security.

3. **Logging**:  
   For production, ensure that warnings and errors are sent to admins using the `ADMINS` configuration in the settings.

## Deployment

DjangoPlus comes pre-configured for smooth deployment. A separate production settings file (`production.py`) is included with:

- Secure SSL/HTTPS configuration.
- Hardened security settings like `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, and others.
- Settings for deploying on popular platforms (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).

Ensure you follow these additional steps during deployment:

- Set environment variables (such as `DEBUG=False` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS`).
- Use a production-grade database like PostgreSQL.
- Apply your preferred web server and WSGI/ASGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, Daphne).
